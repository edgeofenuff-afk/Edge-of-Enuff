# 🌪️ Apocalypse Event — *Edge of Enuff*

**Fantasy**  
Periodic world-scale threats hit your outposts — meteor storms, acid fog, raider swarms, supply line collapse. Survive by adapting and re-routing what you’ve built.

**Trigger**  
- Timer or server-wide announcement: “Storm front inbound — 2 min.”
- Map visuals change (sky darkens, sirens, UI alert).

**Player actions**  
- Stockpile fuel/food, close gaps in fences, reinforce weak links.  
- Re-route convoys or evacuate parts of the base.  
- Deploy drones/beacons to predict impact zones.

**Feedback**  
- Base takes damage if under-supplied or under-defended.  
- Survive: bonus resources, unlock new tech (“storm shields,” “emergency rails”).  
- Fail: partial loss but no shame — rebuild faster next time.

**Hidden learning**  
- Rates of consumption under stress (fuel/time).  
- Coverage & redundancy (geometry / networks).  
- Risk/reward tradeoffs.

**Social**  
- Players can aid each other (send supplies, fortify neighbor’s fence).  
- Cooperative events: “guild storm bunker.”

**Lore hook**  
- “Enuff is unstable — storms mark the world’s final collapse.”
